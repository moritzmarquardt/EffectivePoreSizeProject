# Project setup
Set up vpn connection to uni stuttgart network
First, connect vs code via remote ssh extension to the workstation and open this project folder.
I created a python venv on the workstation in this project folder under .venv with the vs code venv python extension. 
The python version was 3.8.1 and the following packages were installed:

biopython==1.83
contourpy==1.1.1
cycler==0.12.1
fasteners==0.19
fonttools==4.48.1
GridDataFormats==1.0.1
gsd==3.2.1
importlib-resources==6.1.1
joblib==1.3.2
kiwisolver==1.4.5
matplotlib==3.7.4
MDAnalysis==2.4.3
-e git+https://github.com/moritzmarquardt/MembraneAnalysisToolbox.git@c662823d710bda4627163c5df806880ac252b45f#egg=MembraneAnalysisToolbox
mmtf-python==1.1.3
mrcfile==1.5.0
msgpack==1.0.7
networkx==3.1
numpy==1.24.4
packaging==23.2
pillow==10.2.0
pyparsing==3.1.1
python-dateutil==2.8.2
scipy==1.10.1
six==1.16.0
threadpoolctl==3.2.0
tqdm==4.66.2
zipp==3.17.0

when opeing then a terminal in vs code, the venv is active and you can run the python files in the venv by just clicking on the run button.
However, this does not support the plotting of interactive plots from pyplot. The plots just dont appear.
To solve this, either the plots can be saved to png files or:
Log into the workstation via ssh from the ubuntu subsystem for windows using this command:
ssh -Y st166545@129.69.167.51 (this forwards the graphics to the local machine). This makes it possible to view the interactive windows.
This x11 forwarding with the -Y command only works when connecting to ssh via the linux subsystem. When trying to connect via ssh with -Y from the windows powershell, he forwording does not work

The whole project folder is synced with a github repository using the vs coode extension.
